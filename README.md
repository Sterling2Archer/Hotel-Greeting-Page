# Hotel-Greeting-Page

Hello, this is a greeting page for a hotel, The Himmapan Hotel. Users are greeted depending on the time of day, and are provided information on how to reserve a room at the famous Himmapan Hotel in Thailand. I designed the hotel's logo using GIMP, and the main background image is from the famous video game Hitman 3, based on the games The Himmapan Hotel. I designed the phone number to represent the main character, Agent 47, by making the hotels phone number spell out 1-800-47-TARGETS (correleating the letters with actual numbers from a phone). This project is based on developing JavaScript skills with variables and data, and building design skills with CSS and HTML.
